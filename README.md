# imagecaptioning
Open the notebook to see the entire code about building an image captioning model from scratch. This model takes as input images and captions associated with them it learns by converting the image into image features which is accomplished by a pretrained model here, then it works similar to an encoder decoder based machine translation model instead of tranlating a language it translates the image features into captions. The decoder is based on transformers.
